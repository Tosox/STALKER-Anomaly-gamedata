This repository contains the unpacked gamedata files of the version _1.5.2_ of the stand-alone mod [S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly)

> [!NOTE]  
> The level files are zipped, and the archives are sometimes split with [7z](https://7-zip.de/index.html) because GitHub limits the maximum file size to 100MiB.
> Furthermore, I can't just use Git LFS since the storage capacity for the free plan is also limited.
