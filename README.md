This repository contains the unpacked gamedata files of the version _1.5.2_ of the stand-alone mod [S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly)

> [!NOTE]  
> The level files are zipped, and the archives are sometimes split with [7z](https://7-zip.de/index.html) because GitHub limits the maximum file size to 100MiB.
> Furthermore, I can't just use Git LFS since the storage capacity for the free plan is also limited.

> [!NOTE]
> GitHub cannot properly display Cyrillic text in the right encoding, resulting in some files appearing broken (such as [rus/_game_version.xml](gamedata/configs/text/rus/_game_version.xml)). However, there's no need to worry, as downloading the file and selecting the correct encoding (Windows-1251) when opening it will ensure that the Cyrillic text is displayed correctly.
