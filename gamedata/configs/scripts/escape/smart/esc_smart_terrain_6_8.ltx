;            FACTION CONTROLLED SMART_TERRAIN
;=================================================================
; this smart is an example on how to use faction_controlled feature.
; when faction controlled is enabled, the controlling faction is decided
; by the last npc who entered the smart. If he is the only faction present it will shift
; control to his faction.
;
; default_faction is the starting faction for the smart.
; 
; The respawn sections are created dynamically for each faction listed with faction_controlled.
; When the smart is controlled by this faction, it will only spawn this faction. 
; In this example, bandits or army can spawn here if one of these factions comes here. Otherwise this smart will not be a respawner.
; 
; Make sure you have props set up properly in simulation_object_props.ltx
; This uses the actual community names found in game_relations.ltx (ex. stalker, bandit, csky, army, dolg, freedom, ecolog, killer, monolith)
