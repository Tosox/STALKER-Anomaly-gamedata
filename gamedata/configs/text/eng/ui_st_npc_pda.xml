        <text>But what caught my eye the most is this Springboard anomaly. Unlike others, the radius is around 5 metres. It's massive!</text>

        <text>Do you want me to take measurements of it?</text>

        <text>How about I plant a few sensors around the field so you can see the readings yourself?</text>

        <text>I’ll try and gather more readings and make more observations. I'll send the data over when I’m done.</text>
