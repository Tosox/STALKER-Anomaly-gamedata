		<text>Firestarter set</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_matches_descr">
		<text>A simple set of sticks of pine wood impregnated with resin. Anyone who has ever tried to light a fire in the open air knows that random gusts of wind can extinguish the flames very quickly. The firestarter set allows you to create a small but steady hearth fire, the temperature of which is significantly higher than that of paper or wax. An indispensable thing in any campaign, because it easy to light up even in the wet.\n\n\n

		<text>Hexagon wood stove</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wood_stove_descr">
		<text>This compact foldable oven is intended for cooking single entree meals with dry wood. However, since wood found within the Zone is far too contaminated to be used for that purpose, stalkers rely on imported charcoal as the cheapest and most widely available burnable material. The stove can produce temperatures sufficient to grill less poisoned mutant meat, but preparing more toxic meat requires the utilisation of more advanced equipment. Basic fire skills are needed. Made of stainless steel and ultralight titanium.\n \n
		%c[ui_gray_3]NOTES:\n \n
		%c[ui_gray_1]Although charcoal is available in the Zone at relatively cheap prices, you need to use a significant amount of it in order to prepare a single meal. For this reason, charcoal is not as cost effective as it would seem. On the other hand, it is relatively light, which makes it perfect for longer trips deep in the Zone.\n \n
		%c[ui_gray_1]Mutant meats that do not require high temperature to be prepared are referred to as 'low-tier', whereas those that require high temperature - 'high-tier'.\n \n

	<string id="st_army_bowler_descr">
		<text>This army kettle features a convex-concave bottom profile, concave on one side. It is supplied with a wire handle-loop for hanging and carrying. When worn on the waist belt, the concave side should be placed to the body. The bowl cover can be used as a pan when heating or preparing a second dish. The handle of the lid is designed to hold it, securely closing the lid when carrying, and a tablespoon is inserted into the special holes on the handle.\n \n
		%c[ui_gray_3]NOTES:\n \n
		%c[ui_gray_1]Since fuels used in the multi-fuel stove are much more efficient energy-carriers than the wood or coal, the multi-fuel stove is - in the long run - significantly more cost-effective than traditional wood or coal stoves. On the other hand, these fuels are usually carried in heavy metal containers, which makes them more suited for use at bases, rather than in field operations.\n \n

	<string id="st_fieldcooker_descr">
		<text>The stove has been tested extensively over many years and has been used on countless expeditions. It is extremely robust, reliable and powerful and was designed to handle demanding situations, extreme altitudes and both low and high temperatures. It has a very high output and can be used with virtually any kind of fuel, including butane, gasoline / petrol, diesel, kerosene / paraffin, and even aviation fuel. Using the separate control knob, you can adjust the flame to the heat you want, even if you are wearing gloves.\n \n

	<string id="st_box_matches_descr">
		<text>A box of matches is the second most important item in the Zone after a weapon. With the help of matches, a fire can be created, a light can be passed to a friend, and small spaces can be illuminated. This particular box was produced in an unknown underground factory in the roundabouts of the Zone, therefore high quality is not to be expected, though the price is not high, either. The box has been permanently crumpled, crumbling sulphur and broken wet matches. Only a quarter of its contents remains usable. Even so, lighting a fire or a cigarette is very difficult if using the matchbox - thus, stalkers tend to purchase a more expensive but practical lighter.\n \n
