			\n%c[pda_green]Information%c[ui_gray_1]
			\nWith this feature enabled mutants and other stalkers will lose their clairvoyant ability to know exactly where anomalies are located.\n
			\nAs such, they will now find themselves placed at the full mercy of the Zone's environment no different from your own character.\n

			%c[pda_white]Delayed repairs%c[ui_gray_1] allows technicians to retain your equipment.\n
			\n%c[pda_green]Information%c[ui_gray_1]
			\nWith this feature enabled, broken weapons, outfits, and other items which you bring to a technician will be kept in their possession until they have completed all repairs.\n
			\nAfter handing over your items you can speak with the technician again to ask whether they are ready for pick-up, to which they will either return them or tell you how much time is still required.\n
			\nThis adds a somewhat realistic enhancement to the traditional repair system, suitable if you are seeking a harder experience, as it will no-longer work instantaneously and instead emphasise the use of gunsmith and sewing kits.\n

			%c[pda_white]Enhanced recoil%c[ui_gray_1] adds much more varied and realistic handling of weapons.\n
			\n%c[pda_green]Information%c[ui_gray_1]
			\nNormally when firing your weapon the only effect that the built-in recoil system provides is that it gradually raises your reticle, animates your weapon, and slightly increases the spread of your bullets.\n
			\nBecause of this the normal system is somewhat flawed as by firing in short bursts and slowly moving your mouse downward at the same time, you can almost completely negate a weapon's recoil with little practice.\n
			\nWith this feature enabled a much more randomised and multi-directional recoil is created when firing your weapon - this restores the challenge of mastering your weapon and makes your choice of upgrades and ammunition much more influential.\n
			\nIt is highly recommended to only enable this feature if your system can maintain at least a steady thirty frames-per-second, although fifty or above is much more preferable.\n
			\nThis feature can be toggled from the game options menu and is disabled by default.

			\nStalker and mutant population factors can be adjusted independently of one another, allowing you to decide how wild or settled the Zone should be without the need to modify any of the game's files.\n
			\nIt should be noted that the effect is greatest when starting a new character, as if the factors are changed during a playthrough in progress, they will only be realised as stalkers and/or mutants die and then respawn in greater or smaller numbers.\n

			\nWhen making a quicksave the filename will be appended with a number on the end - these numbers are used by the game to help with tracking of multiple different quicksaves.\n
			\nBy allowing you to make multiple different quicksaves before they start being replaced, you will be able to revert to previous progress if you accidentally save at a bad moment.\n
			\nIn short: the higher the value you give to this setting the more quicksaves you will allow the game to cycle through.\n

			\nAs time passes your character will slowly begin to feel tired, with the screen beginning to blur and shake. These effects will proceed to get worse until you find a suitable place to rest or the effects of sleep deprivation cause you to collapse from exhaustion.\n
			\nTiredness can be accelerated through consuming items such as medical kits and vodka, and negated with those such as high-caffeine energy drinks - however using too many will leave you unable to rest until their effects wear off.\n
