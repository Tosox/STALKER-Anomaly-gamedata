It'll let me prepare medicine for almost any potential threat or injury a soldier could encounter while out on patrol.\n \nOr at least, it would, but my request keeps getting postponed. Every second could save a life, so my proposition is this: if you find a decent kit, I'll pay you out of my own wallet for it, no fuss. Just bring one to me as soon as you can. </text>
