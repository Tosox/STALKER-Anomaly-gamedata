		<text>Splendid! Please take a look at this new scanner. We use these devices to scan anomalous acitivites during our scientific expeditions. One of the most interesting anomalies in the Zone is the Symbiont Anomaly, found deep inside the Red Forest. We want this scanner to be installed near that anomaly. It will help us to learn more about it's activity.
		\nThe location is dangerous, but hopefully it won't be an issue for a capable stalker like you. Please install it there for me, I will gladly compensate you for your trouble.</text>

		<text>Ah, well, I'm sure you'd make for a great field assistant, but, the thing is, getting all the necessary paperwork done isn't exactly cheap, nor is it quick without some, er, motivation. You know how these government types can be.\n \nPermanent contracts, licenses, IDs...I'll need at least 17,000 RU from you to pay for all this, especially if you want to see the results within your lifetime.

Please, go to the cache at these coordinates: if you hurry, the documents I wish to recover should still be there.

However, the situation hasn't changed, and we still need more tools. HQ is real obstinate about organising more for us right now, so I'll tell you what.

He wanted me to tell you he's set aside a healthy sum of roubles for the stalker who can bring me a set of expert tools. It should let us get the most out of the scientific gear we keep here - particularly our hazmat suits and exoskeletons. So, are you willing to go toolkit hunting for me one last time? </text>

	<string id="mechanic_army_yan_mlr_task_3_fetch_about">
		<text>I'm honestly grateful for this. When you get back with the tools, I'll also show you a trick or two on how to do proper field maintenance - unless another technician has taught you already, of course. It'll be my way of saying thanks. Good luck out there. </text>
