		<text>Letter to Nikolai</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_letter_stalker_letter_3_desc">
		<text>A hand-written letter addressed to Nikolai. Most probably a part of a longer written conversation between two stalkers. Although correspondence in the Zone is conducted mainly by means of PDA messages, some prefer a traditional manner of communication, especially in case of most private matters and between friends. These letters are then handed to couriers who, like guides, are entrusted with some of the most difficult and dangerous tasks. It often takes a few days before a letter reaches its recipient, but still the probability of intercepting the message is much lower than in case of PDA communication. The courier profession is highly regarded among fellow stalkers and entails a position of significant influence in the stalker community.\n \n
