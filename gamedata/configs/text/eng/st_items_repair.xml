No more loose grindstone, sliding about in drawers, scratching everything - no, everything is now in its place. For perfect sharpening, three important grains for pre-grinding, sharpening and for the subsequent stripping of the blade are integrated in the set, so you can achieve a razor-sharp cutting edge.\n \n

Frequent application will prevent guns from malfunctioning and corroding, especially after prolonged use in combat situations. Prior to lubrication process, it is advisable to properly clean the firearm to remove any foreign material that has accumulated on or inside it. One can also make use of basic tools in order to access the inner parts of a gun so as to maximize the effectiveness of maintenance. A special tuboline increases gliding quality of all movable parts making the oil even better suited for repeaters and automatic weapons. This allows guns to function even at temperatures of up to -55 °C. It has a flash point of 78 °C.\n \n

		%c[ui_gray_1]Iconic Red Army oil that has been in service for almost 70 years. The metal bottle is divided into two separate compartments, one for oil and the other one for the cleaning solvent. In the beginning, the solvent was based on an alkaline solution for effective clean-up of preservation salts in which ammunition was commonly shipped and stored. Since then, the composition of liquids has been modernized many times, but the simple yet ingenious 'double' bottle design remained unchanged. "Dvojka" is very popular in the Exclusion Zone due to its versatility. Bear in mind, however, that the oil requires adequate tools to be spread properly and so that it can reach deep into weapon's inner mechanisms. "Dvojka" should thus be regarded as more of an add-on than a stand-alone maintenance item.\n \n

		%c[ui_gray_1]Western-made, high-quality firearm cleaning solvent, especially adapted for use in harsh environmental conditions, the Hoppe's No. 9 Bore Cleaning remains perhaps the most commonly used solution. Like all cleaning solvents, it is designed for preventing rust and removing powder, lead and metal fouling, but its unique property is that it makes heavy particles less likely to stick to mechanical parts of a firearm. This proves especially useful in the irradiated Zone. Substance acts quickly, is super-efficient, safe and easy to use. Although it flows freely and penetrates rapidly, it is still advisable to use tools or fabrics to increase spread.\n \n

		%c[ui_gray_1]M17 is a result of a Soviet military-industrial research project intended to devise an extremely potent, single-ingredient adhesive which could be used in any situation regardless of purpose and materials involved. It was decided to use a highly potent methacrylate which is most often optimized for reacting with either plastic or metal. In case of M17, however, this limitation has been bypassed, making the substance equally effective in both areas. In addition, the adhesive received a significant boost to versatility thanks to its hydrate form: it can be diluted with water and used in any concentration depending on the intended result. There is almost no damage that the glue, combined with appropriate materials, won't be able to repair. Can be used with all materials available in the Zone.\n \n

This is especially useful to prevent further structural damage of already damaged suits. Due to a relatively low durability of provided materials, the kit can be used only for minor repairs and is ineffective in case of harder materials like kevlar or metal. For this reason, the kit has a very limited use in headgear maintenance.\n \n

		%c[ui_gray_1]This kit contains everything that is needed to perform effective repair of modern combat helmets. It features heavy tools that will allow you to work on hard materials such as kevlar, steel or titanium, as well as a very strong, methacrylate-based adhesive. As the kit does not contain any sewing equipment, it cannot be effectively utilized for reparation of flexible materials of armors, but it can be used to disassemble headgear sets to greatly improve the effectiveness of repair.\n \n
