		<text>One of my best men is currently hiding out among the enemy, trying to learn their secrets. He's usually a solid guy, so when he begins missing our contact times, I begin to worry. I have a hunch he's been ratted out, and that the squad he's with is now quietly waiting for the perfect opportunity to silence him permanently. We need to get him home. He left me a location ping, but he's with other stalkers. You need to take care of them and bring my man back in one piece. You will recognize him by his rifle, an SVD. He will have to shoot at you to maintain his deception when you attack the group, but he won't be aiming too well, so don't hold a grudge.</text>

		<text>Do you have explosives? If so, I've got a big job for you. Right now, the military is bringing armoured vehicles into the Zone to reinforce their troops. I ask you, is this fair? Look at the rusty, dysfunctional pieces of junk we have rotting in our warehouses! If we can't have tanks that work in the Zone, then neither can the government! My spies say these vehicles are arriving to be stationed at the Cordon checkpoint as we speak. Don't worry, they'll make sure the vehicles are unmanned when you pay your visit, so you can destroy them without being turned into swiss cheese. You want in? Then pack your pineapples and get going!</text>

		<text>Sleep has been a little harder around camp lately. Each night we hear screaming, but before we can do anything about it, yet another one of our men on the road gets swallowed by the darkness. We find their mangled remains strewn about the Bloodsucker Village the next day.\n \nLukash thinks a rare breed of bloodsucker may be in town. A darker, stronger, more vicious motherfucker that only comes out at night. A few of our war-dogs think we should cease night hikes until it migrates and hopefully starts messing up Duty instead, believing it's too risky for us to go after it directly.\n \nWell, I say if you've got the stones to wait for it in the Village after nightfall, I'd be thrilled to shower you in roubles for killing the bastard, and the rest of the lads around here will be grateful to get a good night's sleep again.

		<text>Yeah. You know how rough and tumble life can be in Freedom, right? Dodging bullets and fighting fanatics is just part of the daily life around here. As badass as it makes Freedom's fighters feel, it also means we're getting short on meds. Since Solid is too high off his ass to organize medical supplies, that responsibility now falls to me.

		<text>Well, there is something important that needs looking at. Here's the thing: short of risking our luck in Belarus, there are precisely two scientific bunkers that Freedom can contact for anomaly-diving supplies. No more, no less. One is sandwiched between Duty thugs, military goons, and who knows what else. The other is a light jog away from Pripyat. And both...are sponsored by the very government we fight against. We need to start stockpiling new artefact hunting equipment NOW in case either of those places suddenly becomes cut off from our runners. I need you to begin gathering Bear detectors and artefact containers wholesale. I understand everything I'm requesting will take a while to obtain. Don't fret, your payment will be adequate. If you go the extra mile and get some batteries, you'll even get a bonus, too. So, you in?</text>

		<text>Yeah, you know what isn't right? We're sitting right in the middle of one of the government's old armouries - it was a real storehouse for their special forces, back in the day. Yet half the amazing gear they left behind has just been lying around, rusting to shit because we don't have the proper tools to maintain everything.\n \nWe should change that. Bring me another toolkit - something more advanced this time. It's time to show the Man we can run His war machines better than He can!</text>

		<text>Well, the bad news is most of the big guns stashed in the armoury really can't be saved at this point. The good news is this - I could do some real nice calibrations on the equipment we do have working, even our exoskeletons. What I'll need, though, is a more precise set of tools.\n \nCare to help Freedom tech up one more time?
