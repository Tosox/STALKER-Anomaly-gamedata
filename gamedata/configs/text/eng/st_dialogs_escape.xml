		<text>A fresh face... Or have I seen you around before, stalker? I'm the guy to see if you need any equipment. If you're looking for money, I'm always in need of someone willing to do dirty work.\n \nI look over this camp; all stalkers are welcome to rest here as long as they stay out of trouble. I warn you, do not mess with the military, I work my ass off to make sure they don't crack down on this place. If you get shot by them, that's on you and you alone. Stalkers should be relatively safe as long as they leave the soldiers alone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_trader_start_dialog_2">
		<text>Hey, stalker! What do you need?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_trader_start_dialog_esc_m_trader_task_1_complete">
		<text>Business is taken care of? Good work, here is your payment.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_trader_start_dialog_esc_m_trader_task_2_complete">
		<text>You have a real talent, you know that? Here is your payment. This will be good for business.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="devushka_3_quest_0">
		<text>Sidorovich, here's Hip's delivery, as promised. She trusted me to bring the artefacts to you - here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_3_quest_1">
		<text>Hm, always was a little naive. Here, Hip's payment. Tell her to go see Barkeep, and soon - she's been wanting to move up in the world, and this is her chance. There is a delivery that needs to be made from the Bar to somewhere past the Barrier.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_3_quest_2">
		<text>Thanks. I'll let her know. Do you think she'll be up for this?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_3_quest_3">
		<text>Hip's been in the Zone for a long, long time. Ran with Freedom, but didn't stay long after they moved into the Army Warehouses. She's been hugging the borders like a rookie ever since, wasting years away doing a whole lot of nothing. Barkeep's job will straighten her out, one way or the other. </text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_ask">
		<text>What can you tell me about business around here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_1">
		<text>Well, for the winter months, many orders come in from the Great Land asking for pseudodog furs. So if you want to treat a lady and keep a sweet devushka warm this winter, rather sell the pelts to me than some scientist.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_2">
		<text>I shouldn't be saying this, but some dopes around here will pay for anything. I've had multiple requests for "Bloodsucker teeth" - yes, yes, I know - from people who believe owning one will give them good luck. Yeah, right. I almost feel bad about parting those fools from their money. Almost.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_3">
		<text>You know, some days I pick up artefact orders from the least expected of people. Some jewellers came in the other day looking for Stone Flowers. Well, hopefully, they've made some lady happy and, if they know their craft, she hasn't acquired a...eh...fatal glow by now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_4">
		<text>Con men. Even in the Zone, I get plagued by con men. For instance, take this one weirdo I had to deal with: he went around to other stalkers, claiming to be my sales representative. He used my reputation to get better prices, and then tried to hand off second-rate stuff! Weapons with broken barrels, shoddy armour that falls apart to a stiff breeze, expired canned goods...\n \nHis death warrant was signed as soon as his mischief found its way back to me. Once my customers started complaining to me about him, thinking I was somehow involved, I had no choice. His ass got whacked. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_5">
		<text>The military has pretty low morale here overall. What this means for business is we get a small influx of deserters who break off and join the stalking economy every now and then. Most of them are just grunts who don't last a week, but others really get far in life after breaking free from their governmental overlords.\n \nSo, every once in a while, an ex-Spetsnaz will hang around Cordon in the Rookie village. Now, a stalker is a stalker, so I don't really mind them - even if most others would naturally feel a bit of mistrust.\n \nThe issue is when these former soldiers get big ideas and think they can run my business better than I can. Like this one special forces guy who tried to get a gang together and coup my operation. Luckily, he met a rather convenient death in his sleep and, as such, his greedy dreams never came to fruition. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_6">
		<text>You seem quite curious about the way business works here. What, you want to become a trader yourself or something?\n \nUnless you have the contacts and credibility needed to negotiate and sell at competitive prices, unless you have your own source of supplies, you'd need to come to me. You would need to play by my rules.\n \nBut as it stands, I'm not interested in helping to set up more traders right now. Loris, just north of the railway bridge, is already enough of a handful. I need more hunters, more hitmen, more runners, more salvagers, more explorers! Not more traders.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_7">
		<text>Well, I can share this little tidbit - nothing's worse for business than bandits. They're a constant nuisance, roughing up my couriers, shaking down potential freelancers, stepping on the toes of my more regular clients. I tell you, bandits are always bad news in my book. So that's why I don't waste words with them.\n \nIn fact, I don't waste words with anyone who interferes with my people. My reach is far, and anyone who tries to hurt my operations, or mess with someone I care about, can find themselves on bounty lists halfway across the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_8">
		<text>The best way to make money around here, stalker, is to keep as many doors as you can open. For instance, look at my relationship with the military - by all accounts, my presence and operations here are illegal. Yet here I sit, just a short stroll away from one of their main checkpoints. Why?\n \nBecause I've handled their documents, I've sent them rare mutant specimens. I've seen things and learned secrets about them that'd cripple them beyond recovery if they ever got out. And yet they can't silence me because I've made myself the reason such secrets ultimately stay that way - secret. And I can obtain things for them that no one else can.\n \nWe trade favours, and it's part of the reason little sanctuaries like this rookie village get to remain in relative peace. Don't underestimate the value of turning potential enemies into useful assets. Don't disparage the use of subtlety over force.\n \nNow, if only I could reason with bandits the same way... ah well. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_9">
		<text>Well, if you want to become a stalker, you come to me first. I can provide shelter, supplies, and work for all the rookies out there. There's a military outpost not far from here, but we've come to an agreement, hehe, so they usually don't disturb the stalkers in here. Just don't tick them off, okay? The relationship between this village and the military outpost is a delicate little ecosystem... and I don't need any hotshots messing it up. Anyway, I suppose you're here on business? Need a job? Remember - you scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_end">
		<text>What do I look like to you? A big, fat storyteller? I'm done talking! That's it for now! Either buy something, do something useful or go pester somebody else for a while!</text>

<!-- Wolf -->
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_wolf_start_dialog_1">
		<text>Hello, stalker. What brings you to the village today?</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="wolf_st_1">
		<text>I'm the local boss. Many wannabe adventurers come here with wicker baskets and blankets for a picnic, thinking they're Redrick Schuhart or something and, of course, the Zone swallows them whole. Friggin' nerds and hippies. My job's to make sure they don't become mutant food on their first day in this incredible place. It ain't easy, you know? Even with Fanatic helping me teach the rookies... I've spent a good chunk of my life in the Zone. Worked with the legendary Marked One, or rather Strelok, a while back. I've travelled around, even tried to leave a few times, but there was always something that would hold me back, like a military raid. Or another emission, or a profitable job... So here I am, still babysitting rookies.</text>
	</string>
	
<!-- Fanatic -->
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_fanat_start_dialog_1">
		<text>Hello, stalker. How are you today?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_fanat_start_dialog_esc_m_trader_task_2">
		<text>Do you need something, stalker?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_fanat_about_esc_m_trader_task_2_0">
		<text>There are bandits that need taking care of at the car park. Sidorovich said you may want to assist me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_fanat_about_esc_m_trader_task_2_1">
		<text>Yes, I'll help you. I don't want any more harm to come to any of the rookies.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="fanatic_st_1">
		<text>Fanatic's the name, that's what they call me. I'm basically Wolf's deputy here. I help out training the rookies for the most part. You know, they're quite a handful. Teaching them how to shoot with their shoddy guns, telling them where they can and can't go, culling the mutants, keeping army boys and bandits at bay, there's a lot to do even so close to the Zone's border. But it's enjoyable, you know, especially when they come back to you with their first artefact and that glint still in their eyes. I'm not complaining. I still remember what it was like to be a rookie myself.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="fanat_training_start_0">
		<text>Hey...I don't think I've seen you around here before. You seem pretty new, too. I'm the deputy leader of this village, along with Wolf. If you'd like, I can teach you some things about Zone survival, make sure you won't die to the first mutant or anomaly you encounter.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_start_1">
		<text>You know, I could actually use a little help. I'm ready to learn.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_start_2">
		<text>No thanks, I'll live and learn at my own pace.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_start_3">
		<text>Excellent. First, let's teach you how to hunt mutants. There's a small herd of boars on the other side of the road nearby. Now, boars have thick skulls and tiny brains, so the best way to deal with them is shoot them in the side, or - in a perfect world - right up the butt, from a nice, safe distance. We'll take them out together, but try keep them off me - they're in heat this time of year.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="fanat_training_boars_death_0">
		<text>Phew, that was crazy. What now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_boars_death_1">
		<text>Well done. See if your knife's strong enough to get a few parts off of them. When you're done, let's head to the nearest anomalous zone.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_0">
		<text>Here we go, what do I need to do now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_1">
		<text>So, this pit is full of gravitational anomalies. See that artefact over there? That's just a loaf of Anomalous Bread, ignore it. But also in this pit is a Jellyfish, and Jellyfishes, along with every other artefact, have both positive and negative qualities... It's quite fortunate that one is here. Now, let's talk about the equipment you should have for artefact hunting.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_2">
		<text>Show me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_3">
		<text>Here, an Echo Detector. All detectors, while active, register the presence of artefacts and measure the distance to the nearest one. They're a basic requirement for finding any artefact that isn't just junk. When you hear it beeping, then you know an artefact must be nearby. The more frequent the beeps, the closer the artefact. Unfortunately, this old model can't detect all types of artefacts, but it should be fine for your attempt today. Better models have better detection range and abilities.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_4">
		<text>Not bad.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_5">
		<text>Now the second tool, a Lead Container. Do you still remember the talk about artefacts and their positive and negative qualities? Just about every artefact worth carrying is radioactive these days. The Lead Container can completely seal the artefact inside, keeping you safe from its radiation, but also prevents you from using its other effects until removed. Without it, your ass would begin glowing and you'd die in less than a few hours of carrying even a single artefact. It's quite heavy, but better safe than sorry. If you actually want to use an artefact on yourself, it's best done with a more advanced container - scientists call them "Artefact Application Modules" - which will protect you from the rads without blocking its other qualities. Sidorovich sells all of this from time to time, but he usually saves the AAMs for more experienced stalkers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_6">
		<text>Good to know. This container sure is heavy alright. What's next?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_7">
		<text>Next is this bottle of Nemiroff. Like I said, almost all artefacts are radioactive these days, and even if you brought a Lead Container the anomaly field itself is still going to give you a little glow. This bottle will help you...eh...'pass' some of that glow out of your system.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_8">
		<text>Great, anything else?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_9">
		<text>Oh yes, bolts. Never forget about these before jumping inside anomalous fields. Throw some around to find your way through the surrounding anomalies.
		\nThat's all. Let's go. I'll cover you from here on.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="fanat_training_artefact_taken_1">
		<text>Hey, I got the artefact!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_artefact_taken_2">
		<text>Well, well... I can see you'll be an experienced stalker one day. Let's head back to the village - we'll continue your training there.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="fanat_training_back_to_village_1">
		<text>That sure was something...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_back_to_village_2">
		<text>Tired? You seem to know the bare basics now, but I've got an extra challenge for when you're ready.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="fanat_training_stash_search_0">
		<text>I'm ready. What is this challenge?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_stash_search_1">
		<text>Tell me, what self-respecting stalker has never found another's secrets? The Zone is common to everybody here. Those who manage, eat. Sometimes, finding a stash is not just an achievement, but a necessity. I've hidden a little 'nest egg' somewhere in the village - try to find it.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="fanat_training_stash_found_0">
		<text>Found it... Thanks for the artefact.</text>
	</string>
	<!--string id="fanat_training_stash_found_1">
		<text>Huh... I see that with your level of perception, the Zone won't be taking you so easily. Your final lesson is about to start. Take some time to prepare.</text>
	</string-->
	<string id="fanat_training_stash_found_1">
		<text>Huh... I see that with your level of perception, the Zone won't be taking you so easily. That was your final lesson. You've certainly proven to be your own stalker, and you should be proud of it. There's nothing more I can teach you.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="fanat_training_bandit_raid_start_0">
		<text>And what is our final task?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_bandit_raid_start_1">
		<text>You'll see. As you know, the most insidious enemy of man - strangely enough - remains a man. For a long time, we've kept the vehicle station clear of all the bandits, but they keep coming back. They've been a steady threat, usually numbering from around five to seven. Let's go take care of them.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="fanat_training_bandit_raid_end_0">
		<text>Hah, the two of us against these... We're heroes!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_bandit_raid_end_1">
		<text>What you just called heroism here is commonplace for more experienced stalkers. Anyway, let's head back to the village.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="fanat_training_end_0">
		<text>Thanks for taking me under your wing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_end_1">
		<text>Eh, it's what I do. Here, I've got some info on a route from Agroprom to Yantar in case you haven't already heard of it. Rest up for a bit, and then... Agh, who am I to tell you what to do? You've certainly proven to be your own stalker, and you should be proud of it. Now scram. Breathe in that delicious radioactive air and be free!</text>

	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_321">
		<text>Here it is - GP37, a new-generation assault rifle. Accurate, reliable, and convenient with a built-in optical scope. It was previously owned by a UN observer. Their group was sent to the Zone to investigate. However, the situation turned for the worse... 16,000 and the rifle is yours.</text>

		<text>Just a sec. Here's a modular FT-200M rifle, the brainchild of Belgian gunmakers. Accurate, all-purpose, handy for both righties and lefties, comes with an optical scope and a grenade launcher. I got it from some unlucky UN observers... That'll be 16,000 extra.</text>

		<text>Here's Tide. Based on a silent sniper rifle, it was specifically designed for military units to fight zombies. Tide yields rate of fire in favour of stopping power, allowing the sniper to pick off zombies one by one without disclosing his location. However, it then became clear that stalkers alone will be enough to stop zombies at the Barrier, so the rifle never reached mass production. This baby's yours for an extra 16,000.</text>

		<text>Here. This is an SVU2-A, a short sniper rifle with an increased rate of fire. I bought it off Mac, the legendary Freedom guard. He swore there are no others like it in the whole Zone. It's an exclusive item, at least in these parts. It'll be 16,000 extra.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_422">

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_431">
		<text>Sure, just look at Lynx here.  Hand-crafted by a local expert. He's deceased now, so there won't be any copies. It looks just like any other rifle, but take it out for some target practice and you'll feel all the difference. It's got a perfect combination of accuracy and stopping power. Add the remaining 16,000 and this baby's yours.</text>
	</string>

		<text>Look here. I managed to get everything off my list - a CS-3a with a helmet. The helmet is nothing special on its own, but it allows for installing a mobile tactical complex, which includes a high-quality night vision system and an active infrared sensor. Now, the CS-3a armour is a real beauty. Excellent protection from bullets and anomalies is a rare feature indeed in a suit as light and mobile as this one. The whole thing will cost you 32,000.</text>

		<text>Specially for you, a SEVA suit. Everything just like you ordered - a closed-cycle respiratory module, thermal resistant, protective electrical circuit, and outer-surface anti corrosion materials. Plus several built-in artefact containers as a bonus. A must-have suit for any stalker. Toss in 24,000 like we agreed and it's yours.</text>

Sometimes our men patrol the roads or roam the swamps but, generally, it's a hostile place for our soldiers.

		<text>There's not much I can tell you unless you're looking for work. I know a guy. He's rich in all senses of the word - silly and privileged in equal measure.

He even wants to find a scoped TOZ that has "seen some genuine Zone action," as a souvenir! And what he wants to pay is absolutely through the roof!\n \nThe problem is, the last guy I met who knew where to find a scoped TOZ is Hunter, and he died years ago. None of the big-time traders below the Barrier seem interested in finding one, either - they don't seem to think it's worth their time.\n \nBut if you find one, bring it to me along with 20 rounds of buckshot, and you'll be paid several times what it'd fetch you elsewhere.</text>

		<text>Yeah. Ever heard of Nimble? Runs a business out of a boat up north? Used to bust his ass for pennies before striking rich with his own business?\n \nI used to be a drug mule for Freedom, but then... well, let's just say the job got a lot less safe, and I'm not just talking about the mutants and Duty patrols either. Anyways, I heard that when Nimble left his group, this is where he came to make all the connections he needed. So here I am, trying to follow in his footsteps.</text>

	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_5">
		<text>Yeah. Sidorovich knows literally everyone worth knowing in this deathtrap. You want to start your own business, but aren't part of some powerful faction? Then you need his contacts, you need his support. Otherwise, some of the greedier people around here will tear you apart... like vultures setting themselves on a dying man.

		<text>And before that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_7">
		<text>Well, even before, he still looked out for me, even if it was grudging. After I left Freedom, he's the one who made sure Duty wouldn't harass me for my past actions, although I think he'd have preferred it if I just left. He treated me like a child, but after Duty he sure as hell didn't protect me like one; I still had to worry about bandits, and some stalkers who wanted me to be more than I could for them.\n \nI know the Zone can do some crazy things to a person after a while, but some stalkers get ideas when they see, well...</text>

		<text>Some people should save that persistence for worthier causes. Luckily, there are some decent people around too. Wolf would treat me like any other rookie, which was great. Over time, I learned how to get on properly with other stalkers. At least, the ones that aren't high off their asses. Sadly, aside from him and Fanatic, life doesn't last long here for most.

	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_12">
		<text>Alright, count me in.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_13">
		<text>No no, I'll leave you to it. Maybe I'll join you on another expedition.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_14">
		<text>Great! Sidorovich has a special order for a Moonlight, a Fireball and a Wrenched. These aren't easy to find, so there's no real time limit to it - but the sooner, the better. I want to build a good rep for dependability, after all.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_15">
		<text>Alright, let's get started then!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="devushka_3_quest_money_0">
		<text>Here's the fifty percent as agreed. I'm certain someone else would've paid much more.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_3_quest_money_1">
		<text>Probably. But what we've definitely done is stick to our word. We've made a nice sum out of this, I'm happy.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="devushka_heal_0">
		<text>Could you carry this medkit for me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_heal_1">
		<text>What? Why would I need to carry a medkit for you? If you can't apply it yourself, you're probably too dead for me to save.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_heal_2">
		<text>Just in case. Trust me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_heal_3">
		<text>You know...that's a good point.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_heal_4">
		<text>Eh, alright. I'll trust you.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="devushka_3_dialog_0">
		<text>That's an unusual ethos for someone in Freedom armour. Even if they are only an ex-Freedomer.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_3_dialog_1">
		<text>Most of Freedom's early members were friends of mine, and I sort of joined up for that reason. I didn't really like the turn their ideology had taken though, or what their faction was becoming. I wanted an adventure with friends. I didn't want to be part of some person's excuse to wage war.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_3_dialog_2">
		<text>Come with me to the campfire. I have some good news for you.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="devushka_4_dialog_0">
		<text>Sidorovich wanted me to tell you something. He secured you a delivery job with Barkeep...problem is that it requires going past the Barrier.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_4_dialog_1">
		<text>Thank you for letting me know. An old friend just dropped me a PDA message, saying something similar. Look, come back here tonight, alright? I need some time to mentally prepare myself for the journey. I'm also still going to need you to watch out for Bloodsuckers for this job, so don't take too long coming back.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="devushka_4_quest_0">
		<text>Hip, it is time. You ready to go check out Barkeep's job?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_4_quest_1">
		<text>I'm not so sure. The message I got earlier...it was from Lukash. He urgently needs an extra hand for a medicine run to their base in Yanov. I know what I said about Freedom earlier, but we both know it's not just them who'll benefit from that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_4_quest_2">
		<text>Lukash will probably find someone else to do the run. Barkeep occupies one of the most central points in the Zone - grabbing his job while it's still available would be better for you in the long run.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_4_quest_3">
		<text>In that case, we should get to Lukash to pick up the meds as soon as possible - every second could save a life.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_4_quest_4">
		<text>Hm, yeah, you're right. Freedom can find someone else to be their mule. Barkeep it is. Let's get going while the going is good.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_4_quest_5">
		<text>Glad you agree. From what I hear, the Freedom leader at Yanov runs a tight ship. Doing this favour for Lukash would save more lives than whatever Barkeep had in mind. Ready to head to the Warehouses when you are.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="devushka_about_artefact_0">
		<text>Do you have any idea where we can find the artefacts Sidorovich wants?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_artefact_1">
		<text>Of course. Moonlights can be found in Electro anomalies, Wrenched in Vortex anomalies and Fireballs in the Burner anomalies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_artefact_2">
		<text>Alright. And I suppose I'll stand guard while you dive into them?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_artefact_3">
		<text>Actually, I will stand guard. You can dive into them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_artefact_4">
		<text>Aren't you supposed to be the artefact hunter?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_artefact_5">
		<text>I told you where to find them, didn't I? Besides, it'd be more fun for you this way.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="devushka_about_semeckiy_0">
		<text>Hey, Hip? Do you know any stories?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_semeckiy_1">
		<text>Yeah, I do actually. Ever heard of Yuri Semetsky? He was famous for dying at least once per day on the Stalker Network. Probably just a glitch, but some say Yuri was one of the first Stalkers to ever reach the Wish Granter. Ever. Rumour was he wished for immortality. The result was him dying, only to resurrect somewhere else at random up to 24 hours or less before his next unavoidable death. Some of his obituaries were really awful. As beautiful as the Zone can be, it holds some dark things best left unexplored.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_semeckiy_2">
		<text>And do you know why Yuri's deaths are no longer reported on the network?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_semeckiy_3">
		<text>Not exactly, but I've speculated. I find it interesting that his deaths stopped reporting shortly after a Stalker named "Marked One" shut off the Brain Scorcher and reached the NPP. I have no clue what went down there, but things definitely changed. Whatever happened, it seems Yuri is now free to remain dead in peace.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_semeckiy_4">
		<text>You don't think he could still be alive? </text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_semeckiy_5">
		<text>Maybe, but I'm not sure what sort of life that would be now. Perhaps he continues as some sort of ghost? I could not say. Stranger things have happened.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="give_devushka_medved_0">
		<text>Hey, Hip! Carry this detector for me, would you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="give_devushka_medved_1">
		<text>Just what I needed - yet another expensive machine that goes "beep".</text>
	</string>

	<string id="devushka_give_present_0">
		<text>What happens next in the future of Hip?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_1">
		<text>You know, I've been thinking things over in my travels with you. Maybe it isn't the right time for me to settle down and start my own business yet. Thought it was what I wanted, but in truth I was just afraid. What I really want is to adventure. I realize now that there's still so much to explore.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_2">
		<text>What about following in Nimble's footsteps?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_3">
		<text>So I can do nothing but sit on a boat all day? Maybe that's how I felt before, but look at this place. How can you bear to sit inside all the time knowing what's out here? I'm not ready for the quiet life.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_4">
		<text>It's mostly death out here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_5">
		<text>Yet here you are, out here, almost every day.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_6">
		<text>What do you mean?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_7">
		<text>It's difficult to describe, but I think I can be happy here. The Zone really is a miracle, and I'd like to see more of it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_8">
		<text>So you're sure you will choose the life of a field stalker over that of a trader? Even once you have the money and connections to settle down?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_9">
		<text>Yes, I'm sure. Maybe once I'm old and fat like Sidorovich I'll change my mind.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_10">
		<text>You're being rash about this. Think it over some more.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_12">
		<text>I already have. I've made my decision. I was hoping you'd be more supportive of it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_11">
		<text>Alright, then maybe stick around. It'll be good to have someone watch out for bloodsuckers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_13">
		<text>Hah! I thought so myself! Here, take this as thanks. You've come through for me more times than anyone'd care to count. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_14">
		<text>Guess that's what teams do, isn't it? Let's go.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="devushka_go_village_0">
		<text>Hip, I think it's best if we part ways for now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_go_village_1">
		<text>Are you sure?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_go_village_2">
		<text>Yeah. You go do you. There is something I must deal with alone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_go_village_3">
		<text>Nah. Just pulling your leg.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_go_village_4">
		<text>Alright. I'll drop by the Rookie Village every now and then, so maybe I'll meet you there? Just, whatever you do, come back alive please.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="adventure_time_with_hip_0">
		<text>It's good to see you again Hip. Will you join me for another trip into the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="adventure_time_with_hip_1">
		<text>You only needed to ask.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="st_hip_news_1">
		<text>Hip: Alright, let's go to the village campfire then. Can't wait to hear it!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_hip_news_2">
		<text>Good luck on your mission, stalkers. Keep your wits about you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_hip_news_3">
		<text>Hip: I wouldn't worry too much about the other job, I'm sure someone else is handling it by now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_hip_news_4">
		<text>Beard seems pleased with his service, and this wasn't exactly the safest of courier jobs. Stay alive and this could be the start of a good business relationship.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_hip_news_5">
		<text>Hip: Hey, guess you were right about getting in good with Barkeep first!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_hip_news_6">
		<text>Hip: I know it isn't always easy doing something just out of the goodness of your heart.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_hip_news_7">
		<text>Hip: So really, thank you. You've probably helped make a world of difference for Yanov.</text>
	</string>
