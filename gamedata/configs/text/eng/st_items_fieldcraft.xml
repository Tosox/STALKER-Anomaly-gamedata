		<text>A makeshift protective plate consisting from two sheets of metal plate taken out of an armoured vest.

Using the attached synthetic harness, it can be strapped around the front or the back of the torso. It has limited protective capabilities - constitutes a cheap but weaker alternative to kevlar or steel plates. Additionally, any type of armour plating also helps to maintain suits in good condition, preventing degradation through wear and tear.\n \n%c[ui_gray_2]PROPERTIES:\n%c[d_cyan] • %c[ui_gray_2] improvised military item\n%c[d_cyan] • %c[ui_gray_2] effectiveness of mult. units is stackable\n%c[d_orange] • %c[ui_gray_2] usable for:%c[ui_gray_1] outfit repairs (+9%)</text>
