However, in the Zone it has become popular due to a side effect expressed in violation of the sensitivity of the central nervous system, which allows it to withstand severe injuries, such as gunshot and shrapnel wounds.\n \n

	<string id="st_antirad_cystamine_descr">
		<text>A substance functioning as a radioprotector, used to weaken the effects of radiation on the body. The radioprotective effect of cystamine is based on the ability to bind free radicals - ionised and excited molecules formed in tissues upon irradiation - as well as the ability of the drug to interact with certain enzymes and impart resistance to ionising radiation. The effects of cystamine do not counteract already accumulated radiation.\n \n

	</string>
	<string id="st_tetanus_descr">
		<text>Tetanus vaccine is composed of inactivated tetanus toxin and is used to prevent an individual from contracting tetanus. Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is a disease caused by the bacteria Clostridium tetani which enter the body through open wounds and release a poison called tetanospasmin. Tetanus is a potentially deadly disease because the poison attacks the nervous system blocking nerve signals from the spinal cord to and from the muscles. Animals and mutants alike are prone to carry Clostridium tetani which can be transferred through bites. Injection of inactivated toxin enhances your immunological system and can lead to several positive side-effects. Moreover, this vaccine has been supplemented with several additional anti-toxins making it usable for purposes other than preventing contraction of tetanus.\n \n
