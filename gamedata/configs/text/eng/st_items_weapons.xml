		<text>\n%c[ui_gray_1]The device is a home-made portable electricity generator with a manual drive. It is based on a single-phase asynchronous motor, from an old electrical appliance. The output voltage passes through a step-down transformer to the rectifier, assembled using Soviet Diodes D242 to the Portable Power Unit. Self-excitation of the generator occurs due to the capacitor connected to the auxiliary winding of the motor. The charge is performed by rotating the rotor through a worm gear at a nominal speed of 1300-1500 rpm. The device is equipped with an American-made point-turn ammeter, manufactured by WESTON ELECTRICAL INSTRUMENT. Due to its design, it has quite a lot of weight, but still very much appreciated in the Zone. Some craftsmen can refine this device.\n \n

The receiver is made from steel stampings, the forend and pistol grip are made from polymer. The steel stock folds up and above the receiver when not in use. The flip up rear sight has settings for 100 and 200 metres range, but the relatively short sight base and steep trajectory of the subsonic bullet restricts the 9A-91 to ranges of about 100 metres.\n \n

This particular variant utilises 5.56x45 NATO rounds and has a compact barrel. In the Zone, this assault rifle is a real rarity.\n \n

A, which was designed by the german engineer Dr. Ludwig Vorgrimler. In 1957, Heckler &amp; Koch bought the license to manufacture the rifle, where small modifications were made to the CETME design. Officially adopted into service in 1959, by the Bundeswehr as the G3, it remained in service until 1995 when it was replaced by the G36.

The new 5.56x45mm assault rifle was adopted by the Bundeswehr in 1995 and also found its way into the hands of various law enforcement agencies worldwide, including British police and some US police departments. So far, there have been very few complaints about this rifle. The more common ones being the overheating of the handguards during sustained fire, and the loss of zero on the built in scope of G36KE rifles. Some German soldiers also complained about the position of the dual optical sights and it being easily fogged in bad weather. Otherwise, it is accurate, reliable and simple in maintenance.\n \n

The first FAMAS prototype had been built in 1971, and French military began to test this rifle in 1972. Meanwhile, France adopted a Swiss-designed SIG SG-540 5.56mm assault rifle as an intermediate solution.

The standard individual weapon for the British armed forces, the L85 (in its original A1 version) had numerous performance issues. The improved L85A1 is extremely reliable over a range of climates for various operational scenarios.

It is small, highly reliable, easy to use and maintain in working order. It also suffers from several drawbacks, including short range, low firing accuracy and poor stopping power, while also losing out to modern pistols in its class in terms of weight and magazine size. In 1951, the Pistol Makarova was selected because of its simplicity, easy manufacturing, accuracy, and reasonable stopping power. Rust has made this model considerably less reliable</text>

The RG-6 entered limited production by mid-1990s and is now in use by various elements of the Russian Army and special forces, as well as by special forces in MVD (Internal Affairs Ministry). The RG-6 is designed to fire all standard 40mm caseless grenades, available for general issue underbarrel launchers, such as GP-25 and GP-30. These rounds include VOG-25 fragmentation grenade, VOG-25P bouncing fragmentation grenade and "Gvozd" (Nail) nonlethal tear gas grenade for riot control. The drum is also front-loaded.

The RPG-7, in its first version, known as RPG-7V, has been adopted by the Soviet army in 1961, and is still fielded in Russia and at least 50 more countries. By far, RPG-7 can be considered as one of the most successful anti-tank grenade launchers ever made. Initially thought of as an anti-armour weapon, it was later adopted for other fire support missions with the introduction of other types of grenades, such as anti-infantry HE-FRAG and multi-purpose Thermobaric/FAE. The RPG-7 is a shoulder fired, single shot, smoothbore recoilless launcher, grenades are loaded from the front, and the rear of the barrel is fitted with venturi nozzle. Due to the recoilless design, the backblast is dangerous. The RPG-7 is usually issued with 2.7X fixed magnification optical sight, designated PGO-7. It is a simple and inexpensive, but possess a high threat to modern tanks and can also serve in a number of other roles, making it a flexible weapon.</text>

Relatively light for a sniper rifle but well-balanced and having semiautomatic fire, its precision is good but not exceptional. It has an effective range of up to 800 metres. This variant is in bad condition, which results in higher misfire probability.\n \n

		<text>An unknown weapon, the firing mechanism of which has not been established. The weapon appears faulty - squeezing the trigger doesn't do anything. It's very heavy and definitely high-tech. Of note is that it appears not to fire bullets based on ignition. Most probably, the rounds are propelled by electro-magnetic forces. One can only suspect what kind of destructive potential it possesses.</text>

The weapon was designed with extreme short-range stopping power in mind because it is intended for special units of the FSB which operate in urban environments against heavily armed and organized gangsters and terrorists who need to be killed in one shot. According to the Russian press, the first batch of ASh-12.7 assault rifles was delivered to the FSB.\n \n
