	<string id="st_psy_helmet_desc">
		<text>A psy-helmet designed to fit under regular headgear. It was developed under the leadership of Sakharov at the research station near Yantar. The unique layout of the helmet, consisting of electrical artefacts together with the device’s mounted antennas operate on the principle of the shield. When activated, the helmet projects an invisible dome near the carrier, acting on the energised particles released by the Shell artefact, thanks to which most of the radiation is extinguished, then the remnants are reflected by the protection system built directly into the helmet’s body. The uniqueness of this Psy-helmet lies in its ability to withstand the unusual mind-altering psy-frequencies of the various DUGA emitters within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.</text>

Because the process of conversion from the old internal "porkchop" filters was never standardized, however, there is some slight variance in weight and radiological protection between individual masks. As a general rule, masks like this offer respectable protection in areas of increased radioactive activity, but suffer from a high failure rate in toxic environments and have negligible protection against physical impacts, rapidly breaking when placed under such conditions.\n \n

	<string id="helm_dolg_vintage_descr">
		<text>%c[ui_gray_1] REMOVED FROM GAME. PSM-4 is a heavy and bulky, but very durable combat helmet. It has an integrated, tough gas mask reinforced with a number of metal parts and fit for popular EO-19 filters. It also has a class IIIA anti-ballistic visor. The helmet is very heavy due to its mostly metal construction and very slight use of modern synthetic materials. It is very uncomfortable, but thanks to its thickness it is not only very physically resistant, but also capable of shielding the wearer from a considerable amount of external psy influence. It should be noted, that this thickness, compared with mostly metal build, make the inside of helmet heat up really quickly, possibly posing a threat to the wearer. It is therefore highly advised to take the helmet off when in proximity of thermal anomalies. Even though the PSM-4 cannot be count among more optimal helmets, it is still used by some Duty soldiers who require solid protection, but lack the money to afford high-end gear. There also are some old military equipment enthusiasts, who wear the PSM-4 just for its characteristic, vintage look. \n \n

		<text>%c[ui_gray_1]The ACH-7 (Advanced Compound Headgear, 7 Parts) is a more modern version of the surplus steel helmet. It is marginally better at stopping shrapnel. Its main draw, however, is its surprising resistance to psychic attacks, along with its unexpectedly low cost. That said, its lack of a respiratory device makes it an extremely poor choice for the Zone's conditions overall, and is typically only purchased by rookies brave enough to investigate psy-anomalies so early in their stalking careers.\n \n

It is commonly known as the "sawn-off EO-21", as it looks like if someone took the original mask and cut off its upper half. In truth, this mask was designed this way and is meant for use in less contaminated areas. Its main goal, aside of protection of course, is to make using it as comfortable as possible. It can be used both by itself or with an oxygen tank, which can be attached by a pipe to a socket present on the left side of the mask, just above one of its filters. It uses the exact same filter type as full sized EO-21.\n \n

Compared to its original version, the mask was made just slightly more resistant, optimizing it for combat performance to minimize the risk of any heavy damage. Even though it still doesn't stand much of a chance against pistol bullets, it won't crack after receiving a strong punch, and will save the wearer's teeth as well.\n \n

Since then the suit was upgraded multiple times, but the base design (based on Sunrise suit) remained the same. In its current, modernized version (GP-5M) its main components are the Sunrise suit with specially treated fabrics and more rubberized parts, as well as with a larger number of pockets. A common and old but still reliable GP-5 gas mask is integrated with lightweight oxygen tanks carried on the back. The main goal of this outfit was to provide much more radiation protection than the regular Sunrise, making journeys to the north not as dangerous. Even though it is often called a budget SEVA suit, it doesn't even come close to its level of anomalous protection. The suit is meant to be worn in highly irradiated areas, but it doesn't stand much of a chance against stronger anomaly fields. Version C of the outfit additionally bears a camouflage pattern of different shades of green, enabling the wearer to easily hide in dense foliage. \n \n

		<text>%c[ui_gray_1]NOT IN GAME. A higher quality version of the regular Sunrise bodysuit, made of more resistant and expensive materials. The main build of the suit is pretty much the same as that of basic Sunrise, but the use of higher quality materials lead to increased protective qualities without a significant increase in weight. The suit is also more durable and has a potential for more advanced modifications. The "Vineleaf" version is mainly focused of increasing the wearer's mobility and comfort without reducing its protective qualities. It achieves this goal by the use of a more flexible, thermoactive fabric; the outfit slightly shrinks when exposed to a high heat. Stalkers who just bought the outfit make their way to the nearest thermal anomaly and stand next to it for a while - the outfit then shrinks and fits their body perfectly as a result. Even though it sounds dangerous, nobody ever reported the suit disturbing their blood flow. This fabric also seems to be a bit more difficult to cut, therefore making the suit grant more protection from attacks of weaker mutants. One last quality of this suit is that its inner layer is treated with a compound which slightly cools the body, increasing comfort. As its name suggests, "Vineleaf" bears a camouflage in colours similar to that of a vine or ivy leaves. The pattern consists of large, irregularly shaped spots of lighter and darker shades of the colour.\n \n

	<string id="ace_outfit_description">
		<text>%c[ui_gray_1]One of the most technologically advanced bodysuits in the Zone, if not the most advanced. The ACE is a masterpiece of Zone outfit design; not only does it protect from rifle bullets, but it also provides great environmental protection. The suit is also built in a way that allows for a great number of high-tech upgrades that increase the wearer's chance of survival even further, on top of allowing extreme comfort through smart selectively permeable materials. The suit is used by highly experienced and wealthy Mercenaries on high-risk contracts, particularly in areas such as the Red Forest, where they would need to be ready for anything.\n \n

		<text>%c[ui_gray_1]The official version of a military exoskeleton. Released in limited quantities by special order to the Military Stalkers, who must pay for it themselves. Designed to carry heavy weapons like grenade launchers and machine guns, along with enough ammunition, food and meds to keep the unit supplied for long periods of time. Occasionally fielded in lieu of light vehicles.\n \n

	<string id="cs_exo_outfit_description">
		<text>%c[ui_gray_1]An experimental version of the army exoskeleton smuggled into the Zone from Ukrainian factories before being refurbished by Clear Sky technicians. Generally, suits like these are held in reserve, to be deployed only in times of true crisis. That said, especially trusted comrades and associates of the faction may eventually receive permission to acquire such a suit for their own personal uses, although  not without great cost.\n \n

		<text>Scientific exoskeleton</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ecolog_exo_outfit_description">
		<text>%c[ui_gray_1]An official version of the military exoskeleton, intended for use by the Ecologists' guards. The suit feels almost impervious to small arms, and its advanced servomotors make it an excellent choice for those in entrenched defensive positions, as it greatly aids in the use of heavy defensive weaponry. When out in the field, wearers of this suit are more commonly used to carrying the ludicrous amount of batteries, LLMCs, AAMs and other supplies an accompanying scientist might need when exploring the Zone.\n \n

		<text>Renegade exoskeleton</text>
	</string>
	<string id="renegade_exo_outfit_description">
		<text>%c[ui_gray_1]One of a few exoskeletons assembled by the Renegades back in 2011 to help secure their final push into Clear Sky's base. Unfortunately, they were virtually wiped out before their final victory ever came, thanks to the interference of a Mercenary with a trench coat and a marksman rifle. Modern Renegades who wear this armour always go into battle like a man possessed, eager to mete vengeance upon their most hated foes. That is to say, almost everyone else.\n \n

	<string id="isg_exo_outfit_description">
		<text>%c[ui_gray_1]The official version of the UNISG exoskeleton. Released in limited quantities by special order of the United Nations. While it still possesses many of the design flaws of other exoskeletons, it's nonetheless seen as a great alternative to light, command and scout vehicles, which would have great trouble navigating the Zone anyway, and thus is deployed in their stead.\n \n

		<text>Vyraj power armour</text>
	</string>
	<string id="greh_exo_outfit_description">
		<text>%c[ui_gray_1]High-tech armour, based on the original experimental military designs. However, as far as anyone can see, its servos are made of alloys and materials unknown to any field of science in any other part of the world. Consists of a three-part exosuit (tactical helmet, tactical vest and an anti-ballistic environmental jumpsuit) fitted with modern, if somewhat alien, powered servos. Wearing this suit creates an unnatural feeling of bliss and calm within the wearer, although whether this sense of security is genuine or not remains to be seen.\n \n

		<text>%c[ui_gray_1]A next generation exoskeleton, consisting of a doubly reinforced exosuit and an armoured Czech-M10 gas mask. This suit is rumoured to have been the brainchild of a now deceased stalker named "Fang", whose designs were later claimed by all sorts of powerful factions across the Zone. If regular exoskeletons allow stalkers to feel like a light vehicle, the Nosorog almost makes them believe they're a main battle tank, able to withstand incredible punishment while carrying tremendous ordnance. Typically only available to a faction's most valuable members, and even then only during exceptionally dangerous missions.\n \n

		<text>Ghillie suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ghillie_outfit_description">
		<text>%c[ui_gray_1]This suit is designed to simulate a ‘heap of foliage.’ Usually this type of suit is worn by snipers and hunters to blend in with the environment and hide themselves from enemies. Ghillie suits are commercially produced, but usually both military personnel and civilians customise and improve them to suit their needs. Despite its high efficiency, it can be very impractical: even in a temperate climate, it becomes hot over time and is very heavy.\n \n
