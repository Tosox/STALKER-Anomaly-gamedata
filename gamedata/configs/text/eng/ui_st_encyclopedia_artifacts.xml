		%c[pda_white]Artefacts%c[ui_gray_1] are objects that have been changed by the conditions of the Zone.\n
		
		\n%c[pda_green]Information%c[ui_gray_1]
		\nMost artefacts have strange and useful characteristics. For example, when kept close to the body, some artefacts create a protective field that increases its user's resilience to damage. Others may increase the user's stamina or protect against fire, etc. Artefacts are also valuable scientific study material and outside corporations would pay a hefty price to obtain one of these artefacts from the Zone.
		
		\n \n%c[pda_blue]Birth of an artefact%c[ui_gray_1]
		\nArtefacts are formed from anomalies, exposed to certain objects or conditions: The combination of an ordinary object (or of ordinary objects) and an anomaly, the degeneration and death of an anomaly, or if the anomaly is exposed to certain conditions.
		\nAn example is the Crystal where it is a combination of metallic substances and the Burner anomaly. Emissions are known to be the catalyst in the actual creation of an artefact, although scientists in the Zone are still unable to explain how this happens.
		
		\n \n%c[pda_yellow]Financial uses of Artefacts%c[ui_gray_1]
		\nArtefacts are very valuable and stalkers commonly sell them to traders, who in turn sell them to high profile buyers ranging from the military, scientists, or large business companies down to collectors.
		\nScientists, notably Professor Sakharov greatly value artefacts as they are great research materials and claim that they could be the key to answer the world's problems and the key to several technological advancements.

		<text>%c[d_green]Information\n%c[ui_gray_2]A compound of several hollow organic formations, this artefact emits a gaseous substance that can neutralize chemical or toxic particles inside the body without harming it. Bubble, however, possesses numerous negative properties. For example, it greatly amplifies the effects of psi-waves as well as fields produced by mutants and anomalies. This disadvantage is not to be taken lightly: some stalkers have reported that the psi-influence was so potent when in possession of a Bubble that they felt their heads cracking from the inside and the only thing they could do was scream in pain and run as far as they could. The same mechanism seems to be at work in the case of Electro anomalies: the artefact will conduct electricity and increase amps. Moreover, many reports by stalkers indicate that Bubble needs a power source to be functional. This power source is the body itself: the artefact drains vitality and willpower from the user, often on such a scale that it induces dizziness and in extreme cases causes the user to faint. The only other positive aspect to this artefact is the fact that it speeds up the healing process and closes up wounds, however it is so potent in this regard that its high price on the market and the demand for it are perfectly justified. Radiation output is highest on the artefact radiation scale. WARNING: Because of its organic nature and instability this artefact is well known to spontaneously combust more so than any other organic artefact and for this reason it is advised to abstain from wearing it in the vicinity of a fire or acid anomaly.\n \n%c[0,200,200,200]PROPERTIES:%c[ui_gray_2]\n \n%c[0,225,225,225] • %c[ui_gray_2] artefact\n%c[0,100,100,255] • %c[ui_gray_2] attachable</text>

It will catch fire when exposed to open flame or even spontaneously combust. Another downside to this artefact is that it will increase the negative effects of psi-waves and is a potent conductor. It also drains energy from user's body. Stone Blood will, however, speed up wound recovery due to its organic nature.

		<text>%c[d_green]Information\n%c[ui_gray_2]This artefact resembles melted cheese interspersed with sapphire-like stones. Only the yellow outer shell of the artefact appears to give off radiation and by careful processing it is possible to extract the non-radioactive blue parts for jewelery and other industrial purposes. This is due to the fact that if cleaned properly and polished, the sapphire comparison becomes much more explicit: the stones are as hard and durable as that beautiful gem. This quality of theirs and their appearance make them perfect gemstones and jewelers all over the world strive to have them in stock. The usefulness of the artefact, however, is not limited to its industrial applications. There is scientific evidence suggesting that sapphire-like stones effectively protect from toxicity, whereas the outer shell slightly increases resistance to heat. Due to its density the weight of the artefact has increased beyond normal standards, and thus it is one of the heaviest anomalous creations in the Zone.

		<text>%c[d_green]Information\n%c[ui_gray_2]This artefact is formed in anomalous zones with intense thermal activity. Actively consumes excessive heat but remains cool at all times. It will also protect the user against acids found in toxic and chemical anomalies. On the other hand, exposure to such environments makes the artefact increase the corrosivity of acids due to an as of now unknown mechanism. For this reason, one is forced to weigh the pros and cons of Crystal when in the vicinity of areas of high toxicity. It also acts as a conductor of electricity. Another positive effect possessed by this artefact is that it accelerates clotting if worn close to the body. (Side note: it is not recommended to keep this artefact in your possession for long periods of time as blood clots can be hazardous to your health.) This artefact is also highly sought for by jewelers outside the Zone as its inner core is not radioactive and considered to be of exceptional beauty if polished and refined. Only the first 1 cm of its outer layer emits radiation. It is, however, highly advised to proceed with caution when planning to bring the artefact to the market as prolonged exposure to even minimal amounts of radioactive materials can result in the death of the user. Covered with a very hard layer. Relatively heavy due to a high density.

The artefact is quite popular in the Zone and is valued by its residents and visitors alike for its energizing properties, although it has an adverse effect on the body when used for prolonged periods of time. One should take note, however, that this artefact hinders blood clotting and increases the bleeding rate of open wounds.

This strange artefact was considered devoid of any useful properties by many scientists for a long time. Only recently has it been discovered that it is indeed quite beneficial. It provides a high level of psionic protection and absorbs electromagnetic interference, acting as a grounding material. When the artefact comes into contact with the body, it will make one feel rejuvenated and thus it increases stamina recovery. This effect has in the case of some stalkers induced hyperactivity. One downside of this artefact, however, is that it reduces the number of platelets in one's blood, thus increasing one's bleeding rate. Shell is extremely light and very portable.

		<text>%c[d_green]Information\n%c[ui_gray_2]Shaped like a DNA helix, Mama's Beads are created in the Burner anomaly. One of their most characteristic features is that they constantly pulsate, generating emissions beneficial to the human body. These emissions increase the metabolism of any living creature, accelerating the coagulation and healing of wounds. The mechanism behind the effects of this artefact is still unknown. Mama's Beads also possess potent protective qualities: they are able to shield the body and objects from extreme heat and acids. On the other hand, it should be noted that the presence of this artefact increases the corrosivity of acids, leading to the accelerated deterioration of equipment and higher damage to the tissues of any living organism. It is thus strongly advised to proceed with caution in acidic as well as in toxic environments when in possession of Mama's Beads. Another dangerous effect of this artefact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so the probability of electrocution while wearing this artefact is much higher, especially during storms and in the vicinity of electrical anomalies. The weight is also quite high for such a small artefact, which leads to the conclusion that is of extremely high density.

Flash acts as a powerful resistor and will absorb even lethal doses of electricity. On the other hand, it is extremely important to note that each time it comes into contact with electricity, it will release a static build-up which, while not deadly, can have an effect similar to a Taser shock. The artefact has weak regenerative properties and its direct touch has a similar effect to a plasma globe, making one feel energized.

This orb of considerable beauty also increases electrical protection by reducing conductivity in the body when exposed to high levels of electricity. It also enhances energy and stamina recovery, allowing its user to feel energetic and refreshed. An unwanted side effect is that it decreases one's healing rate and coagulation.

It can be found most commonly in or near electro anomalies and it seems to have absorbed their certain characteristics: it is able to smooth out the density fluctuations of an electric field and acts as a weak resistor, protecting the wearer from electricity and reducing its damaging effects. When worn, the artefact is also known to slightly counter the harmful effects of psi-anomalies or the psi-waves of some mutants.

		<text>%c[d_green]Information\n%c[ui_gray_2]This artefact, which resembles the human eye, considerably increases the metabolism of the body, helping wounds heal quicker. Experienced stalkers say that Eye also brings luck. Irrespective of the validity of that statement, its positive effects are indeed quite potent. First of all, it reduces the temperature of the user's body and it cools all objects in its vicinity. Secondly, it provides substantial protection against all types of acids by gradually increasing their pH to the level of water (pH of 7). Thirdly, this artefact soothes pain and is extremely useful when treating wounds. These beneficial qualities, however, come at a price. This artefact is extremely dangerous when exposed to chemical anomalies as it amplifies their toxicity and increases their potency. It is hence highly recommended to keep the artefact in your backpack, never on the body, when exploring toxic areas unless you have a death wish. The artefact is also known colloquially as "Copper Eye" as it conducts electricity and amplifies its dangerous effects in the same way as copper does.

Produces powerful infrared emissions which intensify metabolic processes, healing wounds before its bearer's very eyes. As this artefact is very rare, it is extremely valuable. As in regards its effects, it is similar to the Eye in that it will reduce the temperature of the user's body, which is especially useful when exposed to potent heat sources. It also acts as powerful resistor, and negates the effect of acids. Moreover, its healing capabilities are even stronger than in the case of the Eye as stalkers in possession of this artefact are said to have survived being wounded by Chimeras. Thanks to that, it has earned the reputation of being a miraculous artefact. Many stalkers owe it their lives, and most veteran mutant hunters carry it in case they run into danger. However, it shares not only the positive but also the negative properties of its cousin: entering a toxic or chemical anomaly with this artefact on the belt is suicide. It will increase the corrosivity of chemical particles and enhance the adverse effect of the toxins within the user's bloodstream. It can also be used as a reusable medkit of sorts since it heals wounds very quickly.

This allows it to absorb heat from its vicinity and to create a little pocket around the user which prevents the flames from damaging the body. The stability of its temperature is the cause of another of its positive effects: it accelerates the healing rate and stops bleeding. It will also protect the user from chemical burns. However, it is unrecommended to approach chemical and acid anomalies when in possession of this artefact as it will increase the adverse effects of acids and toxins in the user's bloodstream.

For unknown reasons, scientists are spreading rumors among stalkers that the artefact modifies the bearer's genetic code, which is unproven and should be regarded as a conscious attempt at monopolizing the supply of the artefact by the scientific community. This does not, however, mean that it is completely harmless. One drawback of this artefact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so it is best to avoid Electro anomalies when in possession of the artefact, especially since its negative effects are not balanced with positive ones. It will also reduce energy recovery, which is the result of its sharp needle-like appendages. The needles cause small and quickly healing wounds which bring constant pain and itchiness, thus reducing stamina. This artefact also weakens protection against psi-emissions produced by anomalies or mutants as well as from heat and acids due to its high flammability.

Thanks to the meticulous research that followed, it was established that this new artefact is produced when three Gravi artefacts interact and get sucked into another's singularity field. This phenomenon is extremely rare, due to which the artefact is highly valued. It is rumored within Ukrainian Spetsnaz circles that in the Zone there are agents from the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation whose sole objective is acquiring and transporting Goldfish to specialized laboratories located outside of the Zone. The artefact creates a constant gravitational singularity field which affects only in its closest vicinity. However, some stalkers have been known to disappear for no apparent reason leaving only a Goldfish behind. The artefact provides exceptional thermal and acid protection. Furthermore, it also forms a protective and almost greasy film around its user which has the qualities of strong fire retardant and also protects the user against acid by breaking down elements comprising of acids into simpler substances.

For a long time, the artefact was a mystery, and it was Professor Sakharov at Yantar who first discovered that Gravi creates a minute singularity field of a gravitational nature, the phenomenon of which occurs in intervals of 30 minutes. This artefact may yield beneficial results in medicine or warfare if the mechanism behind its functioning is harnessed for the purposes of science. Suffice to say, its positive properties completely outweigh its negative aspects. Namely, it increases the weight of objects as a result of its gravitational field and emits lethal doses of radiation. On the other hand, it will protect the user from the harmful effects of fire anomalies found throughout the Zone and from the acids of chemical/toxic anomalies. However, instead of absorbing deadly chemicals and toxins, Gravi causes chemical compounds to be broken down to simpler substances thanks to its singularity field.

Thanks to its unique properties, the artefact can significantly increase the bearer's muscle tone, thus greatly improving stamina recovery. Due to its high radioactivity, stalkers in possession of it are sometimes jokingly referred to as "Radioactive Snowflakes". When faced with the decision whether to carry it on the belt during a mission, you have to carefully weigh its pros and cons: does it pay to have greater endurance and high protection against electricity at the cost of being constantly exposed to its deadly radiation? Even if you are determined to take it with you, it should be noted that it is not to be used on long excursions to the Zone. Its usefulness in a fight is also debatable as it increases the bleeding rate and it prevents wounds from closing due to its very sharp appendages which sting the user and irritate the skin.

Firstly, when in the closest proximity of a heat source it emits the odor of burning flesh. Prolonged exposure may enhance its flammability and cause it to ignite. While this phenomenon leaves the artefact undamaged, it can cause objects in its vicinity to heat up and in extreme cases to ignite along with the artefact. For this reason, it is safe to conclude that it absorbs heat and is able to convey it to other objects. Secondly, to carry the sponge metaphor further, the pores on its surface are known to absorb small amounts of toxicity from the environment. Thirdly, the artefact slightly amplifies the damaging effects of psy-fields to living organisms by absorbing psi energy and emitting it at a small rate. Fourthly, Meat Chunk is also known to be a conductor of electricity much like the skin of a living creature. Certain sources within the stalker community indicate further that it makes one feel physically drained when used for even short periods of time. Fifthly, probably the most beneficial feature of this artefact is its ability to slowly close up wounds and heal damaged tissues. Radiation output is lowest on the artefact radiation scale.\n \n%c[0,200,200,200]PROPERTIES:%c[ui_gray_2]\n \n%c[0,225,225,225] • %c[ui_gray_2] artefact\n%c[0,100,100,255] • %c[ui_gray_2] attachable</text>

	<string id="encyclopedia_artifacts_night_star_text">
		<text>%c[d_green]Information\n%c[ui_gray_2]This glowing artefact can generate a locally directed gravity field which increases its mass. For this reason, Nightstar is extremely heavy. It provides protection against acids as well as heat. Due to its beautiful inner core it is highly sought after by jewelers all over the world, however it is best to proceed with caution as unskilled treatment can cause the artefact to explode with power sufficient to level a small building. It is thus highly advised to perform the polishing by means of specialized machinery, which minimizes the probability of explosion. Moreover, only the outer core of the artefact emits radiation. Nightstar will also absorb toxic and chemical agents from the environment, which makes it a valuable artefact for artefact hunters, although the amount of toxicity absorbed is negligible. It is, however, relatively cheap and even stalkers with pretty tight budgets can afford it if the opportunity to buy it arises. Radiation output is low on the artefact radiation scale.\n \n%c[0,200,200,200]PROPERTIES:%c[ui_gray_2]\n \n%c[0,225,225,225] • %c[ui_gray_2] artefact\n%c[0,100,100,255] • %c[ui_gray_2] attachable</text>

		<text>%c[d_green]Information\n%c[ui_gray_2]Soul is a unique organic artefact with properties just as unique - it secretes a slimy goo that dramatically increases the recovery rate of wounds. Thanks to its reasonable price and attractive appearance, this artefact is a valuable collector's item. Because of its organic nature, Soul is highly flammable and should not be carried near a campfire or most heat sources. It is known to spontaneously combust when exposed to temperatures exceeding 60°C. The artefact provides a high level of toxic and chemical protection by absorbing chemical agents. It then uses them as basis for producing its gooey substance which, when applied to wounds, soothes the pain and speeds up healing process. On the other hand, Soul amplifies the effects of psi-waves and increases the damage of electricity to one's body. It is also known to drain power from its user. The artefact does not have a high density and is thus not very heavy. Radiation output is low on the artefact radiation scale.\n \n%c[0,200,200,200]PROPERTIES:%c[ui_gray_2]\n \n%c[0,225,225,225] • %c[ui_gray_2] artefact\n%c[0,100,100,255] • %c[ui_gray_2] attachable</text>

		<text>%c[d_green]Information\n%c[ui_gray_2]This bizarrely-shaped artefact appears in places with increased gravitational activity. Acting as a kind of sponge that absorbs chemical and toxic elements, this artefact provides protection from external toxic agents as well as from chemical particles that have already made their way into the body. Although it appears almost organic, it is actually more similar to coral. Due to its non-organic nature, it is nonflammable. It provides protection against acids as well as heat. There is no particular faction that takes great interest in it, so it is mostly sold to scientists who study and experiment on the artefact in order to find the use for it. It has high density and is thus extremely heavy.

		<text>%c[d_green]Information\n%c[ui_gray_2]Firefly interacts with fields unknown to science, considerably speeding up the regeneration of tissue and organs in living beings, as well as normalizing metabolic processes. This artefact can literally get a badly wounded stalker back on his feet in a matter of minutes. On the other hand, Firefly can spontaneously combust when exposed to potent heat sources. It also amplifies the harmful effects of both psy-fields and Electro anomalies, and it seems to drain stamina and decrease stamina recovery. However, it will absorb any and all deadly chemicals within one's body. Furthermore, it admirably protects against toxicity, and seems to inject neutralizing chemical agents into the user's bloodstream, which negate the effects of toxins and nerve damage. For this reason, it is in high demand in military circles as it can make terrorist attacks with chemical or biological weapons more easily manageable. Unfortunately, Firefly is extremely rare.
