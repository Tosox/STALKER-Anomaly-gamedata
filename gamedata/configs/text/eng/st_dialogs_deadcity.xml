		<text>What's there to tell? I'm the local bartender - but who can tell amidst this crap, yeah? We've been stuck here for days, barely maintaining ourselves. I took part in the defense of the president's palace back then, migrated to Switzerland. Then I came to the Zone. I enjoyed visiting the Bar with friends, drinking and reminiscing of older days... During one of such visits I was offered a place in the the Syndicate. It was barely upholding at the time, so Dushman and I are sort of pioneers in this. So what? The roundabouts are fitting, there are people who've been in Afghanistan and Georgia. But people from the Baltic aren't too eager to come, never mind the first world countries.</text>

	<string id="talk_to_aslan_about_lottery_0">
		<text>Heard that you're interested in faction patches.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_aslan_about_lottery_1">
		<text>How can I put this? Personally, no, I'm not "interested" in them - however, with morale being rather low lately, it's an optimal method for our guys to earn some spoils of war. Plus, the high-ups want them. Here's how it works: you bring me patches from stalkers, you get some gear or nothing at all - sometimes the tray's gotta be empty, eh? For twenty-five patches of any faction, apart from those of Ecologists and the Monolith, you have a chance to get a subpar artefact, or not get jack shit. With fifty patches, you'll have a chance to get a decent artefact and some rather solid gear, but there's also a chance that you won't get anything. And for twenty-five Monolith or Ecologist patches, you will get a pretty good artefact with the same chance as for fifty patches of any other faction. Fifty Monolith or Ecologist patches will guarantee you an outstanding item and good equipment dedicated only to the most experienced of stalkers, no chance of losing. You might ask, "why so generous?"... Because many people prefer to keep the patches for themselves as combat trophies.</text>

	<string id="aslan_st_0">
		<text>What's the current situation?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_1">
		<text>Well, the Syndicate only has one central base in the Zone, and it's right here. The path to Yantar is cut off because of the psy-installation, and crowds of zombies sometimes come out of there, along with mutants. Limansk has gone to shit - it's a maze full of dangers. The Red Forest is even more dangerous, since Monolith fighters have settled at the bridge to Limansk while the rest of the area is crawling with mutants. At the Army Warehouses in the east, it's all Freedom territory.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_2">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_3">
		<text>As for any dangers, you'll see those for yourself. Keep in mind, though; when carrying out orders, you've got a job to do, and any emotions are just gonna distract you. Put those aside... There's no room for emotion, no room for morality - only intellect and calculation. And regarding other paths, the safest route is through Limansk. There's plenty of closed space where you'll be safe from sniper fire, and there is shelter where you can hide from firefights, as well as anomalies. The area's quite unpredictable, however - never gonna know what exactly's around the corner.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_4">
		<text>You say the base is central. Does that mean there are any other outposts?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_5">
		<text>There are two minor ones that I know of. The first one is in Zaton, at the edge of the northern marshes. The second one is in the southwest part of the Pripyat outskirts. We've also got a group stationed in the Wild Territory, and you can find our squads in different parts of the Zone when they carry out contracts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_6">
		<text>So anything north of Limansk is Monolith territory.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_7">
		<text>Pretty much. There's an old hospital not far from Limansk. No point in going there - the path to the Chernobyl NPP, as well as the one leading to Yantar are both cut off by psy-emissions.</text>

	<string id="aslan_st_8">
