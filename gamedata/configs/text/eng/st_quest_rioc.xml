Maybe he just lost his PDA or even got killed, anyway I need someone to go there and check what happened. If he died and by chance still got the stuff bring it back.</text>

		<text>We are in a bit of a problem right now, one of our teams went out to perform some anomalous scans but hasn't returned yet. We've tried to contact them but we didn't get any response. When we brought this up with the State Security Service, they said they can't spare the resources or the manpower to go and find our team right now. It currently holds something vital to our research. One of the team members was equipped with a prototype detector, something we rarely take out of the base to use. If you could go to their last known location and find the prototype or the team, we will pay you for your services. I'll mark the position on your PDA when we lost contact.</text>

		<text>Earlier today, a light Duty patrol responded to a distress call from neutrals. They arrived in time to evacuate some stalkers and scientists caught in a major mutant attack, but one of the Dutyers had to stay behind to ensure the escape. The rest of his squad now lists him as missing in action. I'd like you to investigate the site of the attack and confirm his status. If he's alive, heal him as best you can then bring him back. If he cannot be saved, bring back his PDA instead; a martyr's records should be saved for posterity.</text>
