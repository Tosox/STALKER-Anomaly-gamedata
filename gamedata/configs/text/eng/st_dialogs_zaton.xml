	<string id="stalker_guide_about_anomalies_1116">
		<text>Okay, forget about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stalker_guide_about_anomalies_1111">
		<text>Tell me about heat anomalies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stalker_guide_about_anomalies_11111">
		<text>If you see a sort of glimmering, like air steaming over pavement on a hot summer day - that's a heat anomaly. When something gets in it, that spot bursts into an extremely hot flame. At first they thought those were jets of natural gas, but that theory has since fallen into obscurity.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stalker_guide_about_anomalies_1112">
		<text>Tell me about gas anomalies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stalker_guide_about_anomalies_11121">
		<text>This type of anomaly is dubbed such for its strange, never-ending chemical processes. They produce acid that eats your skin in a matter of seconds, as well as toxic gases that eat your lungs just as fast... Thankfully, gas anomalies are easy to spot out in the open. When you walk into one in a dark tunnel - now that's bad.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stalker_guide_about_anomalies_1113">
		<text>Tell me about electrical anomalies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stalker_guide_about_anomalies_11131">
		<text>A very interesting type of anomaly which accumulates a substantial amount of static electricity. Stalkers usually take advantage of the fact that an electrical anomaly can be discharged with any metallic item. They throw a bolt in and dash right through before it charges up again. I prefer to go around - the recharge phase is just too quick.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stalker_guide_about_anomalies_1114">
		<text>Tell me about gravitational anomalies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stalker_guide_about_anomalies_11141">
		<text>They are typically stationary. When you look at a particular spot and notice that objects are distorted behind it - you've got one. And you better keep your distance. All three known varieties react instantly, the moment something touches them. Springboard hurls everything from under it - often at a great distance. Vortex does the opposite: it sucks an object in, crushes it with terrible pressure, only to send the bits flying seconds after. Whirligig lifts its victim in the air, spins and tears him to shreds... An unpleasant end, whichever way you go.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stalker_guide_about_anomalies_1">
		<text>As you approach an anomaly, keep in mind that it's going to be either very hot, or the air will be full of toxic gases, or it will be a radiation hot-spot. There can also be psy-disruptions, but I won't go into those right now. It depends on the nature of the anomaly - be it heat, gas or electricity... or gravity, but I hope you won't have to deal with those. There are also moving anomalies, but that's a different kettle of fish altogether.</text>

		<text>Tell me about moving anomalies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stalker_guide_about_anomalies_11151">
		<text>Personally I've only come across a Comet and a Tesla. The former is a fireball about three feet in diameter. But I assure you, you'll feel the heat from a much greater distance... The latter is, for lack of a better description, a ball of lightning. It's definitely a ball and it's definitely electrical in nature. Both anomalies always keep moving, but usually in closed-loop paths. A careful stalker should be able to easily go around them... Just don't lose your focus.</text>

		<text>I'm Gonta, leader of the hunting crew. We destroy mutants for cash. We can also capture them alive - for scientific experiments or if anyone needs an exotic pet... As Trapper used to say, "To each animal its own bullet..."</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="gonta_about_mutants_0">
		<text>Tell me about hunting mutants.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gonta_about_mutants_1">
		<text>Well, I'm not the most seasoned of hunters, but I can tell you a good bit about animals than run in packs. Flesh, boars, blind dogs, pseudodogs, snorks, hamsters... I even know a thing or two about bloodsuckers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gonta_about_mutants_1111">
		<text>Tell me about boars and flesh.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gonta_about_mutants_11111">
		<text>Okay, flesh are the most harmless of mutants. They try to stay away from stalkers, but they'll fight back if you attack 'em. Now, if there's a boar among those fleshes, that spells trouble. Three hundred kilos of rage is nothing to toy with. Try not to stand in its path as it charges at you... Use its momentum against it. A heavy bulk like that won't be able to turn on the dime, will it? Dodge to the side, then plug it full of shot.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gonta_about_mutants_1112">
		<text>Tell me about blind dogs and pseudodogs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gonta_about_mutants_11121">
		<text>Lone canines aren't that dangerous, but packs of them are a real pain in the ass. They only attack if they're hungry... the bad thing is, they're almost always hungry. If you're up against a whole pack, try to pick them off from a high spot, else they'll just run you over. Especially if there are mature pseudodogs among 'em. They ain't much tougher than blind ones, but much more cunning and dangerous... If one suddenly turns into a whole pack, then remember: you’re being attacked by phantoms. The real pseudodog will hang back and only try to bite you now and again... Try to identify it. As soon as the real dog is dead, the phantoms will simply disappear.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gonta_about_mutants_1113">
		<text>Tell me about snorks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gonta_about_mutants_11131">
		<text>Remnants of humans... A lone snork isn't much of a problem for an experienced hunter. You wait for him to jump on you and pump him full of shot in the air. Now, when there's a few of 'em... You've gotta just shoot at them as fast as you can while dodging their jumps. They know this and usually try to attack together.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gonta_about_mutants_1114">
		<text>Tell me about tushkanos.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gonta_about_mutants_11141">
		<text>A hunter's nightmare... The worst thing you can do is underestimate them because of their small size. They're incredibly fast, agile and always run in packs. When you feel dozens of small fangs tearing into you - that's when you stop underestimatin' and start shootin'... And that's the scariest part: they're extremely hard to hit. That's why I always tell stalkers to carry a loaded shotgun.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gonta_about_mutants_1115">
		<text>Tell me about bloodsuckers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gonta_about_mutants_11151">
		<text>They're expert hunters themselves, with excellent disguise. When they're camouflaged you can barely see them. If you're hunting a bloodsucker, try to startle it. You can see it better when it's on the move... Remember, a bloodsucker will try to sneak up behind you and weave its feelers around your neck. That's some creepy shit, man... If you are unlucky enough to run into a few bloodsuckers, always watch your back.</text>

<!-- Owl (Loner Trader) -->

		<text>Tell me about this quiet harbor.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="owl_story_1">
		<text>And who the hell are you to demand information from me, eh? I'll just tell you what everyone else around here already knows. There was this strange stalker, turned out to be a major of the SSU. He was a good help, and he also dealt with quite a few dangers. It's only recently that everything went downhill... The Yantar psy-emitter and Brain Scorcher were turned on again. There are clearly activities going on at the Chernobyl NPP, and it's within reach. A squad of experienced stalkers went MIA, and after that another squad stumbled upon some Monolith near the sawmill, from what I heard. After that rumble, people left, and the mutants have been using that to their advantage, breeding unchecked. This is no place for rookies, I can tell you that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="owl_story_2">
		<text>Yet I see not all is lost here. Is there anything else to keep in mind?</text>

		<text>Yes. I'm an information broker. You see, some hotshots, they come up here looking to exit the rat race and strike it rich. But up here, there's many dangers - cultists, mutants, zombies, you name it. It's very easy for a stalker to die in these marshes. So if you happen to, uh, 'find' any of them dead...I'll pay for their PDAs, no questions asked. Capisce?</text>

		<text>Ask yourself that, pal. They step ashore from Skadovsk to explore the terrain and search for artefacts, shooting back at everything and everyone who comes rushing at them. They come back on Skadovsk to get drunk and talk trash... enjoy some R&amp;R before the next raid... though, when an emission hits, it's quite a different scene.

		<text>A funny question. Some were out to discover the next artefact goldmine. Some were driven here by the Oasis rumours. Others sought the Wish Granter. And then there are the base human desires: greed and curiosity... Everyone's got their reasons. I'm sure you have yours, too.</text>

		<text>I came here with Grouse after the Scorcher was disabled. But I'm sure that's not what you really wanna know, am I right? I deal mainly in artefacts. The outside is full of trinkets already, so valuable customers want the rare stuff. That's why I decided to set up a stalker camp, where real high-value articles can still be found. I mean, when a stalker comes back with his loot, what does he really need? A cold one in his hand and good ol' human contact, that's what. And that's what the Skadovsk is all about.</text>

		<text>A stalker. We've met before.</text>

	<string id="zat_b18_noah_start_1111">
		<text>I don't recall... Anyway, what do you need?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b18_noah_start_112">
		<text>A stalker. Just a stalker.</text>

		<text>I see. Looking for refuge in the Ark? Feel yourself at home.</text>

	<string id="zat_b3_stalker_tech_start_15">
		<text>A wise choice, my friend. Gotta keep your gun in mint condition... And if you got a bottle or two on you, I can make it upgrade galore in here. Want a parachute sewn to your shotgun? I can do that, hehe.</text>

		<text>Got some booze. Want a shot?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b3_stalker_tech_drink_1_2">
		<text>Nah, I'm off the bottle, man. When I saw item 62, I thought, 'That's it, I'm having the jumps...' See, booze just screws you up. Not a part of a healthy diet. And if I'm gone, who's gonna hammer out ammo for your Gauss rifle?</text>

	<string id="zat_b3_stalker_tech_drink_2_0">
