		<text>Military flasks are intended for storing small amounts of water. Prepared by medics and scientists. First, the water - combined with a special type of alcohol - is boiled at a very high temperature for purification and disinfection. Afterwards, it is cooled in refrigerators, to which it owes its refreshing "spark." The end result is water that is completely radiation-free. If in spite of the above, you still have doubts concerning its purity, you can always use akvatab. Due to the cost of production, military flasks are in a limited supply and are sold at a moderate price. Medics also have them in stock, but they're slightly more expensive as they include the cost of transportation.\n \n

		<text>Tushonka is a common name of canned, stewed meat produced in the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries. The irony is that the idea originally came to Russia in a form of World War II aid transports from the United States. Since then, various kinds of tushonkas have become a primary means of long-time meat preservation, used both by the civilian population and as a standard-issue Red Army food ration. Despite their long expiry date, tushonkas are known for their high nutrition value (mostly owing to high fat content) and a relatively good taste. The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has seen hundreds of types and tastes of tushonkas. In the spring of 2013 'Abakan' minced-meat brand remains the unquestionable king, and certainly the Zone has seen worse than that.\n \n
