		<text>Unique, a device that absorbs electrical energy around itself and partially transforms it into the body, increasing endurance. Excess energy leads to the regeneration of damaged tissues. It mainly serves as an over voltage protection for limited short-circuit shock current, limiting the amount of electricity coming into contact with the body, by closing it to the ground. Represents a rather complex electronic circuit of valuable radio components, which greatly increases the electrical resistance of the body. As a result, the body falls under a lower voltage and is able to withstand discharges of electricity that previously led to death. Thus, it is vitally important to have a current-limiting microreactor when it is necessary to approach electric anomalies or other sources of electricity. Like any electronic object, it can be used as a repair material with appropriate tools and skills.\n \n%c[d_red]\n\n%c[d_red]WARNING:%c[ui_gray_2]\n \n%c[default]It should be noted that such a module will not be able to work properly and provide sufficient protection if your suit does not meet the minimum protection requirements while in an abnormal field.\n \n \n

	<string id="st_hide_burer_descr">
		<text>Skinning a burer is a lot like skinning a twisted dwarf. Add to it an almost unbearable stench of bad eggs and you get the idea why stalkers consider this quite a feat. Reports indicate that whereas the skin offers relatively low physical protection it can be used to absorb and disperse significant amounts of incoming psy waves when worn over the head. Burer's skin has low electrical resistance, thus the wearer is more susceptible to electrical damage. Furthermore, due to the fact that burers are relatively rarely encountered in the Zone, the skin has significant research potential, making it a valuable trading commodity for the scientists.\n \n

		<text>Chimera hide</text>

	<string id="st_hide_chimera_descr">
		<text>Chimera, being one of the most dangerous mutants in the Zone, is not only a significant threat, but can also be regarded as a viable source of wealth. All parts that can be taken from chimera's corpse can be sold for a large amount of money, but it is the skin that is one of the most valued scientific specimens as well as one of the best armour enhancements available in the Exclusion Zone. It offers very good protection properties and, even more importantly, is relatively light-weight thanks to which it does not limit mobility. However, its most unique feature is that organic fibres found in the skin act as very effective electrical conductors. This fact to a large degree confirms reports of recon units (especially those scouting around the AMK Industrial Complex) concerning sightings of chimeras surrounded in what looked like an electrical anomaly, producing discharges on contact with any hostile living organism. Unfortunately, no unit was able to make it back, so there is no evidence confirming the existence of such a creature.\n \n

		<text>Pseudogiant hide</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_hide_pseudogiant_descr">
		<text>The skin of a pseudogiant in many ways resembles the skin of an elephant. It's thick and hard in touch, its texture is very irregular and full of folds which act as the creature's cooling mechanism. The average thickness of pseudogiant's skin is around 2 cm, which makes it very durable and capable of withstanding significant damage. This is, however, at the cost of increased weight. Since pseudogiants are known to often live in areas of high toxicity and radioactivity, the hide naturally adapted to such conditions, which further increases its usefulness. It can also be used to patch even the heaviest of outfits but this process requires the most durable and expensive tools available. It is valued not only for its practical qualities, but can also serve as a prestigious hunting trophy and a rare specimen for the scientists in the Zone.\n \n

		<text>Controller scalp</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_hide_controller_descr">
		<text>As is the case with other humanoid mutants, it's quite an emotional challenge to scalp a controller and it proves to be even more difficult as the face of a controller retains certain characteristics of the person it once was. Confidential sources within the military also revealed that fingerprints of the person who turned into a controller can sometimes be found in the database. Recent analysis shows that not only the hand of the controller is capable of producing psy waves - the whole body is the source of emissions. For this reason, the scalp - when prepared properly - has the ability to absorb and filter psy energy, but for this effect to take place it is necessary to cover your head with multiple scalps. The skin is also electrically conductive. As regards its physical properties, it is light and can only be used for minor outfit repairs. As is the case with all humanoid psy creatures, the skin of a controller is electrically conductive.\n \n

	<string id="st_hide_pseudodog_descr">
		<text>Densely covered with short and stiff fur, the pelt of pseudodog remains one of the most useful, widespread and versatile mutant pelts available in the Zone. It can be easily attached to armour with even lightest of tools, and yet it's quite durable, which makes it suitable for medium-grade outfit repairs. When used as a whole - it can cover significant area of the body with protective layer which increases resistance to both physical damage and heat. The fur also provides effective insulation. However, as is the case with all such pelts, it easily catches radioactive and toxic particles, so it is highly advised to remove it when in radioactive or toxic areas.\n \n

	<string id="st_hide_psy_dog_descr">
		<text>The fur of a psy dog is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful and rare clothing materials in the world. Usually snow white or grey, it is in great demand and can be sold for a hefty sum of money. It's probably made its way into fashion industry thanks to smugglers some of whom have recently turned to hunting mutants. For those in the Zone, it can serve as a blanket, especially during cold nights, and offers efficient rupture protection and mild psy influence reduction when head part of the fur is used as a mask or a hood. However, it easily catches radioactive and toxic particles, so it is highly advised to remove it when in radioactive or toxic areas. Hunters wear it with pride, but only if the creature was slain by their own hands.\n \n

		<text>"Diamond powder" is a common name given to crystal-like substance sometimes found in the belly of all species of psy creatures. It is not known what metabolic processes lead to its emergence and for this reason scientists are eager to pay large sums of money to lay their hands on it. Practical use is limited but some stalkers are known to sprinkle their most cherished hunting knives with it as it makes sharpening significantly easier. It also makes blades look shiny and well-kept.\n \n
