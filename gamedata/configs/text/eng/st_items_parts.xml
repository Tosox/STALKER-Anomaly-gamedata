		<text>
		Even with good supplies, it’s not uncommon to end up with one or more cartridges of what might be considered as “bad” ammunition. Unlucky stalkers might find themselves in very bad situations when their weapons jam at critical moments due to bad cartridges. On the contrary, these ammo parts can be reused for the creation of better variants. That's why some stalkers prefer to keep them around.\n \n
